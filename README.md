# Advent-of-Code-2019
Personal work on the Advent of Code 2019 challenge. Each file contains part 1 and part 2 of each day's challenge.

Debugging artifacts (such as print statements to track state developments) are left in but commented out.
Often I will simply change my part 1 working solutions to solve part 2, so those pieces are also commented out.

Some challenges require additional input files and are named to match the python files.
