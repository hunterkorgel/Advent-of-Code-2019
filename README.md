# Advent of Code 2019
Personal work on the Advent of Code 2019 challenge. Each file contains part 1 and part 2 of each day's challenge.
Each solution is written in Python 3.

Debugging artifacts (such as print statements to track state developments) are left in but commented out.
Often I will simply change my part 1 working solutions to solve part 2, so those pieces are also commented out.

Some challenges require additional input files and are named to match the python files.

About Advent of Code:
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
